This is a responsive portfolio website, pure html5 and css

    *What actually served as my motivation to work on this project was the thought of having an online resume,
    instead ofcarring around a lot of documents when you are going to apply for a job.

    *I built this project to broaden my knowledge on HTML and CSS.
    This project has helped me learn very many thigs when it comes to styling pages with just CSS.

    *Currently, this project does not solve any actual problem, it is just a result of creativity.

    *I learnt how to make good use of font awesome icons, in place of always having to download images to use as icons.
    *I also learnt how to use the 'background blend mode' property in css.
    *I learnt how to make better use of css grid and flex.
    *I learnt how to work better with media queries.

How to get the files for this project:
*Visit the GitHub links above.
*Download the zip file.
*Extract the files on our computer.
*Open the index.html file on your browser.

*Although after downloading and unzipping the files, the portfolio does not really have any functionality yet.
*There is no PHP, or JavaScript to enable the functionalities which you would expect of an actual portfolio.
